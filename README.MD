### DO FUN STUFF

Do Fun Stuff is an app that aids in the discovery of events and matching event preferences between friends. Registered users can view a curated list of events and save those that interest them. Users can also view other users of the app and add friends. The user can view their saved events with a list of friends who have also saved that event and contact them to organize an outing.

### APPROACH
For this MVP, I seeded the database with events and focused on developing the necessary dependencies and views.

### FUTURE FEATURES
In the future, I would like to populate events through an API like Eventbrite or Eventful. I would also like to source friends using Facebook Oauth. Further styling and ux design would be needed in future versions.
